One of the core TAB/RM functions outlined in the TCG spec is isolation of client commands. The spec refers to this as 'multi-user support'. In our implementation this effectively means that the TPM2 commands executed over one client connection cannot effect objects in use by another connection.

This property is great but, as always, in practice we find breaking said isolation very useful. This page documents the use-case driving a controlled break in isolation and some options for its implementation. We'll also get into how these various approaches will impact clients.
